				<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: How is the data gathered and processed? </span><br>
				A: Data on course grades and cumulative GPA comes from UW databases.
				</p>
				<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: How far back does the data go?</span><br>
				A: Pivot uses data from fall quarter 2012 to summer quarter 2016.</p>
				<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: Why isnâ€™t there data for all majors / courses?</span><br>
				A: Newer majors that include fewer than 10 students produce samples  that are too small to generate reliable statistics. </p>
				<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: What is Pivot?</span><br>
				A: Pivot is an academic planning tool that shows  the median cumulative GPA for declared majors at the time of their acceptance into a degree program. You can also view the most commonly taken courses for each UW degree program and the median grade received for declared majors in these courses.</p>

					<dfn>Median</dfn> : The midpoint of the data sample: half the data in the sample falls above the median and the other half falls below it.
