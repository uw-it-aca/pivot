				<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: What is Pivot?</span><br>
					A: Pivot is an academic planning tool that shows the median cumulative GPA for declared majors. You can also view the most commonly taken courses for each UW degree program and the median grade received for declared majors in these courses.
					</p>
					<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: How is the data gathered and processed?</span><br>
					A: Data on course grades and cumulative GPA comes from UW databases.
					</p>
					<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: How far back does the data go?</span><br>
					A: Pivot uses data from autumn quarter 2012 to autumn quarter 2017.
					</p>
					<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: Why isnâ€™t there data for all majors / courses?</span><br>
					A: Majors that include fewer than 5 students produce samples that are too small to generate reliable statistics.
					</p>
					<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: Does Pivot include data on declared minors?</span><br>
					A: No.
					</p>
					<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: How are double majors accounted for in data? What about when a student switches majors?</span><br>
					A: In both cases a single student will produce two data points, one for each of the two majors.
					</p>
					<p class="faq-chunk"><span class="faq-q">Q: Are grades student obtain at other universities considered in Pivot (i.e., Transfer GPA)?</span><br>
					A: No.

				<h2 id="data-viz">Data visualization</h2>
				<p>Grade data is visualized using a boxplot. Below is a guide to understanding boxplots.</p>

				<section id="boxplot-legend"> <img src="{% static "pivot/img/boxplot-legend-wide.png" %}"  style="border:#ddd 1px solid;margin: 1em 0;" alt="an example of Boxplot indicating the range from the lower quartile to the upper quartile that 50% of GPAs fall in. The median GPA is the midpoint of this range.">
				</section>
				<p>
					<dfn>Boxplot</dfn> : A boxplot is a visualization that divides a dataset into four equal parts, minus the outliers*. Half of the data is included in the two boxes in the center of the diagram and the remaining half of the data fall in the two whiskers.
				</p>
				<p>
					<dfn>Median</dfn> : The midpoint of the data sample: half the data in the boxplot fall to the left of the median and the other half fall to the right of the median.
				</p>
				<p>
					<dfn>Upper quartile</dfn> : The middle number between the median and the highest number in the data set.
				</p>
				<p>
					<dfn>Lower quartile</dfn> : The middle number between the median and the lowest number in the data set.
				</p>
				<p>
					<dfn>Interquartile range</dfn> : Represents the values between the lower and and upper quartiles; the middle 50% of the data.
.
				</p>
				<p>
					<dfn>Whiskers</dfn> : The narrow lines extending outward from the lower and upper quartile.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size: 85%;">*Outliers differ substantially from the rest of the data and are thus hidden from view. Outliers in these boxplots are data points that are beyond the quartiles by 1.5 times the interquartile range.
